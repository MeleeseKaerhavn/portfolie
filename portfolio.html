                    <p>This theme combined all of the elements we have worked on through out the fast semester, and adding the element of group work. We had 2 hand-ins with this theme. One being that <a href="https://xn--meleesekrhavn-bgb.dk/1SEM/T05/passionssite/index.html" target="_blank">passionsite</a> where we worked in pairs to plan, shoot and cut a video showing a specific person passion. We also made a website to hold this video, as well as a Lottiefile to add interest to the site. 
                      <br>
                    The second hand-in was made in a group of 4, where we tried our hand at working with an existing company to redesign their current website. We went though the pocess of working with the company to learn about their needs and wishes, and found a common agreement regarding the style and design, by working on the wireframe and prototype together. 
                    <br>
                  After this, we each took a part of the website to develop, woth our agreement of style and conventions in mind, ultimately making a website that fit the vision. here is the <a href="https://www.figma.com/design/iU6EPj7C7BnwHheB8R42W6/Virksomhedssite?node-id=24-2&t=VNftGvEr67nJ0ce1-1" target="_blank">process</a>.

                    <p>This theme wraps up the entire semester. The goal is to use all of the elements used in the previous themes, to make a good and functioning portfolio that holds all of my projects. I'm learning to prioritize my time and to reel back my ambitions, as I would like for the project to be simple and complete rather than ambitious and incomplete.

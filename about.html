                Hi, I’m Meleese! I’m a creative and driven person who finds joy in giving back through continuous volunteer work and community projects. 
                <br>My journey has taken me from my early life in Georgia to building a life in Denmark, fueled by a love for design, learning, and connection.

                    <strong>Fun fact</strong>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I've moved 2 times in USA and 13 times in Denmark, throughout my 27 year life. 
                    <br>Calculations being:
                    <br>27 × 12 + 5 = 329 
                    <br>329 ÷ 16 = 20.56
                    <br>Which means I've stayed approximately 1 year and 8.5 months each place. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Fun fact</strong>
                    <br><br>
                    In 2000 I was sick with Influenza, that quickly turned into respiratory failure. This admitted me to the hospital on a ventilator and in a coma for 31 days. 
                    <br>As my parents were preparing to have me taken off life support, I woke up, essentially saving myself from terminal extubation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong> Fun fact</strong>
                    <br><br>
                    I’m oddly good at loading the dishwasher just right, so that no space is left unused. And somehow I always know when food is ready without setting the timer.
